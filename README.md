Problem statement:

    A financial organization wants to know the driving factors behind loan defaulting so that they can utilise these variables to reduce the risk of loan default.

    Identifying such strong indicators will help them to reduce the loan amount/avoid approving loans to applicants with payment difficulties

    It can also be used to minimize rejecting loans of applicants who are actually capable of repaying.

   

We have the following data:

    'application_data.csv' contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.

    'previous_application.csv' contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
